# ALD_QMS
This is a repository containing code and a tutorial for analyzing quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) data obtained during Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) processes as described in J. Phys. Chem. C 2020, 124, 26443−26454 ([10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c07602](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c07602))

The [tutorial](https://github.com/awwerbro/ALD_QMS/tutorial) tries to explain the concepts behind our methodology and walks through an example data analysis.

The directory [SI](https://github.com/awwerbro/ALD_QMS/supporting_information) contains the (slightly extended) code provided in the supporting information of this article.

The directory [test data](https://github.com/awwerbro/ALD_QMS/test_data) contains a file for testing. This data was collected with a Hiden HAL 7 RC RGA 511 Mass spectrometer. This data was collected on 08/11/2018 and is a full process of 3 pulses LiHMDS followed by 3 pulses TMP (this data is reported in [J. Phys. Chem. C 2020, 124, 27829−27839](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c09284)). Note that for consistent experimentation (unlike this dataset), you would want to avoid exposing the QMS to your full process as described in ([10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c07602](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c07602))
